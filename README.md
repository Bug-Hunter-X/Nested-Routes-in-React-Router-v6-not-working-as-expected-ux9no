# Nested Routes Issue in React Router v6

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router v6.  The problem arises when nested routes don't match as expected, potentially leading to incorrect component rendering or unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The provided code uses nested routes within a parent route.  The expectation is that the nested route will match its designated path relative to the parent route. However, sometimes the nested routes do not work as expected and match paths outside of the intended route structure, leading to errors or incorrect rendering.

## Solution

The solution addresses potential issues with nested route matching, demonstrating how to correctly structure nested routes to avoid path conflicts.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
